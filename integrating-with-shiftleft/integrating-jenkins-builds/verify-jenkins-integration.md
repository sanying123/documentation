# Verify Jenkins Integration

Once you have installed the CLI and authenticated with ShiftLeft, and configured a [final build step](doc:jenkins-final-build-step) or [post build task](doc:jenkins-post-build-task) in Jenkins, verify build integration with ShiftLeft as follows:

1. Select the Jenkins project where you have configured the `sl analyze` (or `sl analyze --cpg`) shell command as a [final build step](doc:jenkins-final-build-step) or [post build task](doc:jenkins-post-build-task).
2. Click **Build Now**.
3. Select the build.
4. Select **Console Output**.
5. Verify that you see successful output as shown below.

```
