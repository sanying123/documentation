## April 2019 Release Notes

### ShiftLeft Ocular

* **New Tutorial on Creating a Code Property Graph (CPG) from a Java Archive**. The ShiftLeft Ocular documentation now includes a tutorial on creating a CPG from a Java Archive. ShiftLeft Ocular creates a CPG for only the application code, and with references to the dependency code. This distinction is made through the use of a built-in Smart Jar Unpacker, which heuristically determines for each namespace whether it contains application or dependency code.

### ShiftLeft Inspect and ShiftLeft Protect

* **SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance for ShiftLeft Inspect and ShiftLeft Protect**. ShiftLeft Inspect now analyzes, and ShiftLeft Protect secures, financial data through SOC 2 compliance. By providing specific visibility into how you are handling financial data, your customers' financial statements and financial reporting can now be protected against the exploitation of vulnerabilities. The Type 1 report assesses the design of security processes at a specific point in time.

* **Enhancements to ShiftLeft Inspect for .Net**. The current version of ShiftLeft Inspect for .Net includes significant performance improvements in both processing time and memory consumption. In addition, numerous bug fixes have been made.

* **JSP support added for ShiftLeft Inspect**. You can now use ShiftLeft Inspect to analyze your JSP pages for vulnerabilities and data leakage. Note that this support does not include JSP Expression Language.

* **Stability Improvements to ShiftLeft Protect**. Stability improvements have enhanced ShiftLeft Protect's ability to function, over time and over its full range of use, without failing or causing failure.


## March 2019 Release Notes

### ShiftLeft Inspect and ShiftLeft Protect

* **Vulnerability Dashboard**. The new Vulnerability Dashboard provides a singular view of application security quality metrics, including a list of vulnerabilities based on static/runtime analysis of applications. You can use these metrics to measure progress of your security improvement over time. [See the associated article](../using-inspect-protect/using-workflow/vulnerability-dashboard.md) for more information.

* **Jira Integration**. You can now integrate ShiftLeft with Jira to automatically generate Jira tickets for the vulnerabilities in your ShiftLeft Dashboard. Refer to the article [Enabling Jira Integration](../using-inspect-protect/using-workflow/jira-integration.md) for details.
